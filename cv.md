### Briefly about myself:
Having started my career as a receptionist I noticed how hardworking are system administrators and decided to work in this area. I didn't even know how a system administrator differs from a programmer and confused the terms. But with the power of my thoughts I found a suitable company that hired me. I started my career with technical support and developed my skills. Two years later, I was promoted to project manager and I was incredibly happy. In the process of project management, I learned many planning and management methods, studied accounting, acquired systems thinking and many other skills. In the process of work, I began to get involved in programming. My fellow programmers were so smart and well-read that I really wanted to understand the code. They are my inspirations, because together they synchronously write large system software. For me they are geniuses of the 21st century. Now I'm on maternity leave and have free time for self-development. I want to use my time wisely and become a full-fledged programmer. I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
